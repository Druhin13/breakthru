# Contributing to breakthru.

Thanks for your interest in helping breakthru.


## Getting Started

breakthru.'s [open issues are here](https://github.com/Druhin13/breakthru./issues)
In time, we'll tag issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors.
An easy way to get started helping the project is to *create an issue*.
You can do that on the breakthru.'s issues page by clicking on the green button at the right.

Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated. 


## Contributions

breakthru. welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to breakthru. should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.
Each pull request will be reviewed and either landed in the master tree
or given feedback for changes that would be required.

Make sure you check the [open issues](https://github.com/Druhin13/breakthru./issues).


## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Try to make small commits if possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
  It helps us to review that as well.

- Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed
  commits.

- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can tag '@-reply' a specific member asking for a review in the
  pull request or comment.

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
